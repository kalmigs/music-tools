# Adding New Pages/Features

## Planning Questions

Before implementing, consider:

- How do you suggest we implement it?
- Do we need to install any packages?
- Show a rough layout for desktop and mobile
- What functions and options should it have?
- What is the ideal route path?

## Implementation Guidelines

- Follow `file-organization.mdc` throughout implementation
- If a function or hook is reusable, add it to `src/lib/`
- Add to: desktop nav, mobile sidebar, and homepage

## Update Checklist

When adding a new page or feature, update these locations:

## 1. Create the Route

```
src/routes/[page-name].tsx
```

## 2. Update Sidebar Navigation

Add to `src/lib/nav.ts`:

```tsx
{
  title: 'Page Name',
  href: '/page-name',
  icon: IconName,
  description: 'Brief description',
}
```

## 3. Update Home Page

Add a card or link in `src/routes/index.tsx` if the feature should be discoverable from home.

## 4. Update README

Add the feature to the Features section in `README.md`:

```markdown
## Features

- **Page Name** - Brief description
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Route file created in `src/routes/`
- [ ] Navigation item added to `src/lib/nav.ts`
